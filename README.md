- **Jira Integration**: Automatically create and update Jira tickets based on PIR status changes, keeping workflows in sync.
- **Data Export**: Export PIR data and intelligence summaries to CSV and PDF formats for reporting purposes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter, the application offers a straightforward, intuitive GUI for TI teams.
